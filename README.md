# HybridELEC
A side-by-side dual-bootable minor fork of both CoreELEC and EmuELEC, enjoy the beauty of both CoreELEC and EmuELEC without continously eject and insert different SD cards/USB drive! Switch the OS with simple one-click GUI operation!

## Project layout
The ``hybrid-ng`` branch is only for introduction of the project, and packing the whole image, the corresponding modified CoreELEC and EmuELEC sources reside in ``coreelec-19`` branch and ``emuelec-4.5`` branch. **NEVER** mix the modified CE/EE sources with official sources

The older Xiaomi mibox3/3c only HybridELEC reside on ``hybrid-1.0`` branch and is in maintainance status. The main ``hybrid-ng`` branch is only for **generic Amlogic-ng** devices

## Documentation
Please check the [wiki](https://github.com/7Ji/HybridELEC/wiki) for device support status, image layout, installation guide, how to switch between CoreELEC and EmuELEC, and how to build HybridELEC by yourself, etc
